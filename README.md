# Unhandled Exception in Node.js HTTP Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js: unhandled exceptions in HTTP servers.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of a server that doesn't handle potential errors robustly. The `bugSolution.js` file shows a better approach.  Unhandled exceptions can cause the server to crash without providing useful debugging information.
